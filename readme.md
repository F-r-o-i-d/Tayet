Why use a cross-language web server?

A cross-language web server like Tayet offers several benefits over traditional web servers that support only one programming language. Here are some reasons why you might consider using Tayet:

- Enables developers to use the programming language and framework they are most comfortable with
- Simplifies the process of integrating multiple technologies into a web application
- Allows for greater flexibility and scalability, as developers can choose the best language and technology for each component of their application

# Why the name Tayet?

Tayet is named after the ancient Egyptian goddess of weaving and textiles. Weaving is a process of bringing together different threads to create a cohesive whole, which is a metaphor for the way Tayet brings together different programming languages and technologies to create web applications. Additionally, the goddess Tayet was associated with magic and protection, which reflects Tayet's role in providing a powerful and secure platform for web application development.

The common point between Tayet and a cross-language web server is that both enable developers to create a cohesive whole from disparate parts. Tayet's role in reassembling the body of the deceased king allowed for the preservation of the body and the soul's journey into the afterlife. Similarly, a cross-language web server's ability to bring together different programming languages and technologies is essential for the development of a functional web application that can be accessed by users.

By using Tayet, developers can build powerful, scalable web applications that incorporate the best of multiple programming languages and technologies.
